  description: 'Near-perfect blend of power, speed, skill, durability, and and showmanship. Won more fights against world champs & Hall of Famers (25) than anyone else. By the Summer of 1942, his record stood at 129–1–2. Only five-time middleweight champion. Showed remarkable longevity, with his championship reigns spanning 14 years. Idol to Muhammad Ali, Sugar Ray Leonard, and many others.',

  description: 'Unprecedented combination of charisma, talent, and controversial convictions made him the most famous (and financially successful) athlete of his generation. Virtually untouchable in his prime, thanks to excellent conditioning, uncanny reflexes, and superb footwork. Dominated two generations of heavyweights, including the supremely talented 1970s era. Only three-time lineal heavyweight champion of the world. Won two out of three in legendary rivalry with Joe Frazier. Upsets of Sonny Liston and George Foreman shook up the boxing world.',

  description: 'Arguably the most awesome puncher the sport has ever known, with a frightening combination of skill, hand speed, punching power, and killer instinct. Made 25 successful lineal championship defenses, more than any other champion in boxing history. Longest-reigning boxing champion in history (nearly 12 years). Only the second Black man ever to win the heavyweight title. Patriotic American hero thanks to victory over Germany’s Max Schemling, service in U.S. Army, donation of purses to the war effort, and representation of hope for African Americans during segregation and the Great Depression.',

Scored 27 consecutive KO wins between January 1937 and February 1938, one of the longest streaks in history. Nearly won a fourth division championship but was allegedly robbed in a fixed fight. Unrelentingly aggressive style thrilled fans and overwhelmed opponents.',

Ultra-aggressive, wild-man fighting style thrilled crowds and outworked some of the best boxers ever. Only man to beat future heavyweight champion Gene Tunney. Engaged in an incredible 309 known prizefights. Likely fought the last 4 years of his career while blind in one eye, yet still very successful.',

  description: 'Defensive marvel whose skills, head movement, and fleet footwork left him virtually unscathed for nearly a decade. One of only two fighters on this list to win more than 200 fights. By 1948, his record stood at 134–1–1, a record likely never to be matched. Was told he might never walk against following a 1947 plane crash but came back to continue as a dominant champion. Four-bout title fight series with hard-hitting Sandy Saddler among the sport’s most vicious rivalries and saw Pep become a two-time world champion.',

Was denied title shot for years due to skin color and abilities, and was likely past his prime by the time he won the title. Beat all three of the other great Black heavyweights of his time (Sam Langford, Joe Jeanette, and Sam McVey) when the white champions refused to face them. Only man ever to defeat heavyweight champion James Jeffries.",

Fought in five separate decades, from the 1960s to the 2000s. One of the few fighters of recent decades to accumulate more than 100 pro wins. Great late-career renaissance in the mid-to-late 1980s, winning belts in two more weight divisions, the last one at age 37.',

Went 6–3–1 in four-way rivalry with other featherweight stars Barrera, Morales, and Marquez. Fight with Floyd Mayweather, Jr. is the richest in boxing history.',
